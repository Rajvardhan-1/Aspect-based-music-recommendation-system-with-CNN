Our facial expression-based music recommendation system utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze facial expressions and suggests music accordingly. By capturing facial emotions like happiness, sadness, and excitement, we train the CNN model to recognize patterns in the data. These patterns are then matched with corresponding music genres or playlists to offer personalized recommendations. This approach enhances the user's music listening experience by aligning it with their emotional state, creating a more engaging and enjoyable experience.
